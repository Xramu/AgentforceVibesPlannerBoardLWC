# Project Job Planner Made With Agentforce Vibes

This project was made by using Salesforce's Agentforce Vibes AI co-pilot.
Most of the code is generated by prompting the Vibes AI in natural language.
Some of the logic has been tweaked by hand to fix any issues.

## Description

A Lightning Web Component to visualize and manage upcoming project dates and data inside a week-based calendar.
Uses Apex to fetch custom project and task data records from the Salesforce org.

The titles on each section have been changed to be a fitting example for a hardware company to keep track of upcoming maintenance jobs.

## Features

- Load & save data from and to the Salesforce org.
- Change the date, handler, estimated cost, name, and description of a task.
- Color-coded tasks based on their handler.
- Drag & drop tasks from week to week inside the calendar.
- Navigate from year to year to see upcoming or past tasks.

## Visual Studio Code Setup

[Resources for installing VSCode for Salesforce DX projects](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/sfvscode-extensions/overview)

You will need to have your Visual Studio Code set up with Salesforce's extensions to deploy this project.

# Deploy To Your Test Org
*Disclaimer: This is a demo project component, you should not deploy this to your org outside sandbox or demo org!*

You can choose between automatic or manual deployment, but first you will have to:

1. ### Clone The Repository To Your Local Machine
    Use git to clone the repository or download it and open it in Visual Studio Code.

2. ### Connect To Your Org

    Press `Command + Shift + P` to bring up the Command Palette.
    Search for the command `SFDX: Authorize an Org` and run it.

# Automatic Deployment

You can use the included Agentforce Vibes workflow called `deploy_project_board` to let Agentforce deploy this project for you.

1. ### Run The Automated Workflow
    Open the Agentforce Vibes chat inside your Visual Studio Code and run the command:

    ```sh
    /deploy_project_board.md 
    ```

    If the workflow was successfully ran, the project board, the required permissions and its mockup data should be deployed to your org.

2. ### View The Project Board
    Refresh your browser and try to search for `Project Board` from the top left App Launcher.<br>
    Click the app and you should be able to view the board with the mockup data.

# Manual Deployment

1. ### Deploy The Source

    Right click the `force-app` folder and select `SFDX: Deploy This Source to Org`

    **OR**

    Run the command
    ```sh
    sf project deploy start
    ```

2. ### Assign Users To View The Project Board

    If not open yet, open your connected org with `Command + Shift + P` and running `SFDX: Open Default Org`

    Click the gear icon (cogwheel) on the top right and go to `Setup` and search for `Permission Sets` in the Quick Find.

    Find and click the `Project Board Access` permission set.

    Click `Manage Assignments` and then `Add Assignment`

    Select yourself and anyone else needed from the list using the checkboxes on the left.

    Click `Next` and then `Assign`

3. ### Deploy The Mockup Data

    Open a terminal window inside VSCode if you haven't already.
    You can get a new window from `Terminal > New Terminal`

    Run the command
    ```sh
    sf data import tree --plan data/import_data.json
    ```

    **OR**

    If the command does not work, try running the command:
    
    ```sh
    sf data import tree --plan data/import_data.json --target-org <alias-of-target-org>
    ```

    Replace `<alias-of-target-org>` with the alias you gave to your connected org.

4. ### View The Project Board

    Refresh your browser and try to search for `Project Board` from the top left App Launcher.<br>
    Click the app and you should be able to view the board with the mockup data.
