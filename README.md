# Project Job Planner Made With Agentforce Vibes

This project was made by using Salesforce's Agentforce Vibes AI co-pilot.
Most of the code is generated by prompting the Vibes AI in natural language.
Some of the logic has been tweaked by hand to fix any issues.

## Description

A Lightning Web Component to visualize and manage upcoming project dates and data inside a week-based calendar.
Uses Apex to fetch custom project and task data records from the Salesforce org.

The titles on each section have been changed to be a fitting example for a hardware company to keep track of upcoming maintenance jobs.

## Features

- Load & save data from and to the Salesforce org.
- Change the date, handler, estimated cost, name, and description of a task.
- Color-coded tasks based on their handler.
- Drag & drop tasks from week to week inside the calendar.
- Navigate from year to year to see upcoming or past tasks.
