# Project Job Planner Made With Agentforce Vibes

This project was made by using Salesforce's Agentforce Vibes AI co-pilot.
Most of the code is generated by prompting the Vibes AI in natural language.
Some of the logic has been tweaked by hand to fix any issues.

## Description

A Lightning Web Component to visualize and manage upcoming project dates and data inside a week-based calendar.
Uses Apex to fetch custom project and task data records from the Salesforce org.

The titles on each section have been changed to be a fitting example for a hardware company to keep track of upcoming maintenance jobs.

## Features

- Load & save data from and to the Salesforce org.
- Change the date, handler, estimated cost, name, and description of a task.
- Color-coded tasks based on their handler.
- Drag & drop tasks from week to week inside the calendar.
- Navigate from year to year to see upcoming or past tasks.

## Setup Guide

[Resources for installing VSCode for Salesforce DX projects](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/sfvscode-extensions/overview)

Once your environment is set up and ready for development:

Connect to an org and deploy the component and custom objects:
- Press Command + Shift + P and run the command `SFDX: Authorize an Org` to connect your Salesforce org.
- Right click the `force-app` folder and select `SFDX: Deploy This Source to Org`
- The `Project Board` custom component should now be available when editing Salesforce Lightning apps.

Push mockup data to populate the calendar:
- Open the terminal inside VSCode.
- Copy & paste `sf data import tree --plan data/import_data.json --target-org <alias-of-target-org>` into the terminal.
- Replace `<alias-of-target-org>` with the alias you gave to your org.
- Run the command to create the mockup records.
