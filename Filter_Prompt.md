Change the projectBoard component to have a dropdown menu for selecting a project.

If a project is selected, only the tasks with the selected project as their assigned project will be shown inside the taskPool and taskCalendar.

At the top of the dropdown selection is an option called "All Projects" that will change the project board back to showing all the tasks.

Each dropdown item for a project should have the project name as its label.
